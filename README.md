## About NC News

NC News is a social news/opinion app. This repo is the front end of the app, and can be used to display the articles, comments, topics and all the other data in the database (see back end repo for more information and a list of currently implemented endpoints).

It was built using React via create-react-app, with Axios for the back end API queries.
